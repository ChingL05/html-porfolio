<h1>Me, who?</h1>
<p>
  Hey I'm ChingYi Lai from Hong Kong, studying in Germany. And nope, I'm not studying anything about the IT at all,
  instead a kindergarten teacher in the making. I've moved to the Europe for over 5 years now,
  at first I came to learn German as the first experience living abroad.
  Then I was a business and econonmic student for 2.5 years in Austria. I was back to Germany as an exchange student,
  yet, ended up quitting the study and started the apprenticeship as a kindergarten teacher.  
  Now I'm learning to code as a 'dedicated' hobby, aiming to switch to another new path later at some point!
  So who am I? <br />
  A person who isn't afraid of changes, open up for challenges, a lifelong learner with social skills (a bit). <br /> 
  Welcome to my digital journal of a journey to be a full-stack developer!!
